If you are using active dry yeast (look like small round balls) - follow the instructions given in the packet.If you are using fast action yeast (looks more like fine semolina) then in a large bowl combine the flours, salt and sugar and gradually add in the yeast and knead the dough until smooth and elastic, adding little flour if it tends to get sticky. Once all of the ingredients form a ball; add the olive oil and place the ball on a work surface and knead the dough for approximately 10 minutes. Repeated kneading combines all the ingredients well and will help the bread rise well in the oven.Once you have finished kneading and gained enough arm muscle; place the dough in a large bowl coated with olive oil and cover it with cling wrap/plastic wrap and allow it to rise for about 2 hours.After two hours you will notice that the dough has doubled. At this point punch the dough down and knead gently. Divide the dough into 10 portions and roll each portion into a ball. Place the balls on a baking sheet and cover them with a damp cloth and let them sit for another 30 minutes.While the dough is resting, preheat the oven to 250 C. The oven should be preheated for at least half an hour before you can bake the pitas in them. Now it should be time to work your dough into flat bread. Take one ball, dust it with a little flour and dust the work surface as well. Using a rolling pin, roll the pita into an oval or a circle. Make sure the pitas are thin; about 1/8th inch or 1/4 inch thick. Continue the same with the remaining dough balls.Place the rolled portion of pita bread on dusted baking sheets and place it inside the oven.

Dust the dough portions in flour and roll out into a circle. Dont roll too thick, as the filling will push itself out and tear when steamed.Place a small spoon of filling in the center of the rolled circle. Bring together the edges of the dough with a pinching and folding motion on one side and bring the other side to hold to the pinched side. By doing this, the half moon shaped momos (dumplings) will have a frilled look. Proceed the similar way with the remaining dough.As you keep shaping the dumplings (momos) you need to keep them on a greased platter and cover with a damp cloth to prevent them from drying out.While you are shaping the dumplings (momos), keep a steamer with water boiling. Grease the steamer pan with some oil to prevent the momos from sticking.Place the shaped dumplings (momos) on the greased steamer pan.

Take care when you roll, as the filling might spill out.If you are using the Air Fryer or the Oven, then preheat them at 180 C for about 15 minutes. Place the Kachoris in the Air Fryer Basket or the Baking sheet (for the oven) and bake until the Kachoris are golden brown and crisp on all sides.If you plan to deep fry them, then preheat the oil for deep frying. Once the oil is heated, fry the Kachoris on low to medium heat until you get a deep golden brown color and it is crisp. Once golden, drain on absorbent paper and proceed to make the remaining Kachoris the similar way.Serve these mouth watering Corn and Matar Kachoris as a tea time or evening snack along with Green Chutney and Date Chutney.

Add the butter and mix the butter into the flour with your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add in a tablespoon of ice water at a time and knead to bring the flour together.Knead to form a firm dough that is firm and does not break apart when you try to press it. Make sure you only add a tablespoon of water at a time, as the warmth of your hand will help bring the flour together to form a dough. Wrap the pastry crust dough in cling wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.After 30 minutes, roll out the pastry dough on a lightly floured surface. Roll it out to make a circle of 12 inch diameter that is about 1/4 inch thick. Lift the dough carefully from the floured surface and place it in a 9 inch tart pan with a removable base.Press the dough into the pan so it fits tightly; press the edges into the sides of the pan. It is important to press the dough evenly into every nook and corner of the pan's ring. Remove the excess dough that is hanging off the sides of the pan. Place the tart crust in the freezer for atleast another 15 minutes. This process of chilling the crust, helps make the crust flaky when baked.Prebaking the Tart CrustPreheat the oven to 180 C. Once the oven is preheated, Prick the chilled tart crust with a fork, so it does not puff up while in the oven. Cover the tart crust with foil, place pie weights or beans on the crust and prebake the crust for about 25 minutes. The tart will look golden brown but not completely baked. Remove the tart crust from the oven and allow the oven to be on at 180C.Remove the foil and pie weights/ beans and keep the crust aside while we prepare the filling.Method for Chocolate FillingWhisk the eggs in a bowl until light and flully. Keep aside.To make the chocolate filling for the tart, place the heavy cream and milk in a sauce pan over medium heat, add in the chopped chocolate and keep stirring on low heat till you see the chocolate melting half way through. Turn off the heat and proceed to melt the chocolate into the milk and cream mixture in the existing heat. Add in the sugar and salt and whisk the chocolate cream mixture until well combined.Next add in the whisked eggs into the chocolate cream mixture and whisk it in well until well combined. The chocolate cream filling mixture is now ready to be poured into the tart crust.Pour the filling into the tart crust and place it back into the oven and bake for about 15 minutes until the filling is set and the surface is glossy. If you see any bubbles or cracks forming on the surface, take the tart out right away as this indicates that the tart is getting overbaked.Keep monitoring the Chocolate Tart while its in the oven, as the baking times differ from oven to oven. It is important to monitor so you don't over bake the chocolate.Remove the Chocolate Tart from the oven, and allow it to cool completely. Refrigerate the Chocolate Tart for about 8 hours until set and serve it along with fresh fruits, like strawberries.Serve the Chocolate Tart Recipe as a Dessert for a Get together Party to amuse your guest.",http://www.archanaskitchen.com/chocolate-tart-recipe,https://www.archanaskitchen.com//images/archanaskitchen/World_Appetizers/chocolate_tart_with_strawberries_dessert_recipe_shutterstock_199527956.jpg

For this heat milk in a heavy bottomed saucepan and bring it to boil.Once the milk comes to a boil, turn the heat to low and simmer the milk with almost continuous stirring and reduce the milk to more than half its quantity. It is important to note that during the initial stages of milk condensation frequent stirring is important, but as it begins to start condensing and reaches less than half the quantity it is absolutely important that you stir continuously. This is because condensed milk tends to get stuck to the bottom and sides of the pan and burn; leading to a very unpleasant taste. Burning of milk is also toxic so you want to be extra careful.Once it the milk is reduced to more than half of its quantity, stir in the sugar until it dissolves completely. Finally stir in the Thandai Paste Mix and give the mixture a good stir. You can even use a hand blender to give it a good whisk.Turn off the heat and allow the kulfi mixture to cool completely. Pour the thandai kulfi milk in the moulds until 3/4th full, seal them airtight and freeze them in the refrigerator.

Add a teaspoon of oil to coat the dough and knead for a few more minutes until smooth.Set the millet phulka dough aside to rest covered for 15 minutes. Knead once again and divide the dough into 8 portions.Preheat the iron skillet on medium high heat. Roll the portions of phulka (roti) dough into balls; flatten these balls with the palm of your hand.Take a portion of the Millet phulka dough, toss it on the flour and roll out into thin circles to approximately 6 inches in diameter. As you roll them out, you can keep tossing the dough in dry flour while rolling; this will prevent it from getting sticky when rolling them out.Cook the millet phulka as indicated in the steps below. Continue the process of rolling with the remaining portions of the dough.*Cooking Millet Phulka (Roti) on Gas StovePlace rolled dough on the hot skillet. In a few seconds you will notice that small air pockets start to form. At this point flip the rolled dough to the other side on the skillet.After a few seconds turn the flame to high; using tongs take the rolled Millet phulka off the skillet and place it directly on the flame. It should balloon into a spherical shape and puff up.Remove the Millet phulka from heat, place it on a flat plate and optionally spread little ghee on the side facing up.Continue the same process for the remaining portions of the rolled Millet phulka dough and keep stacking them one over the other.*Cooking Millet Phulka (Roti) on Electric StoveThis process can be used if you are using a gas stove as well.Preheat an iron skillet.

The rolled out phulka dough should begin to start puffing out.Flip and cook the other side for a few more seconds.Remove from the heat, place the Millet phulka on a flat plate and optionally spread little ghee on the side facing up.

So give yourself time if you are new to bread making.Even if yours does not puff the first time or the times after, the rotis that you have made are cooked and are edible, so you could consume them with your choice of vegetables.Using thinner rolling pins is the key, as you want to be gentle with the dough.The heavy big ones will make you press harder which might just make it tear. Its well worth investing in a thinner rolling pin and tongs to hold the bread which is available in most Indian stores around the world.Tossing the phulka dough in flour as you roll is another helper that will make the rolling out the dough easier.",https://www.archanaskitchen.com/mixed-millet-phulka-recipe-ragi-jowar-bajra-wheat-phulka,https://www.archanaskitchen.com//images/archanaskitchen/0-Archanas-Kitchen-Recipes/2018/Mixed_Millet_Roti_recipe_Millet_Phulka-5.jpg

Set aside 4 tablespoons of chopped nuts for decoration.Put the remainder in a bowl and combine it with 1/3 cup of sugar, cinnamon and cloves and mix well.Method to assemble and bake the baklavaHeat the oven to 170 C. Lay a dish towel on a work surface and sprinkle it lightly with water. Thaw the phyllo dough package according the manufacturers instructions.Unroll the sheets on the towel and then cover it with a second damp dish towel. When unrolling them I encountered several cracks and cuts in the sheets.Do not panic. They are easily repairable and do not make any difference in the dessert.Melt the butter in a small saucepan. Brush a baking pan with melted butter. Take a sheet of phyllo dough and carefully spread it in the pan, folding the sheet in such a way that it fits the pan.Brush the layered sheet with butter and gently press it into the sides and corners of the pan.Lay another sheet on top and brush with butter. Do the same with the third of the sheets. Once 1/3rd of the sheets have been used, scatter half the nut filling over the layers.Layer another third of the sheets in the pan, buttering each one and pressing into the corners and sides. Then sprinkle the remaining half of the nut mixture evenly.Layer the last third of the sheets, buttering them and pressing them the same way as we did with the previous layers. Brush the top most layer thoroughly with butter and pour any remainder of butter on the top (I ignored the last step. I did not pour the remaining butter. I just liberally brushed the top layer and left it at that).So essentially, after every 3 sheets there is a nut layer for the baklava recipe.With a small knife, cut diagonal lines around 1/2-inch deep to mark out the shape. Do not press down too much when cutting.Place the tray in the oven and bake for around 1 hr 15 minutes (It took me exactly 1 hr) until golden brown in color.Method to make the honey syrupCombine the sugar and water in a saucepan and heat until dissolved, stirring occasionally. Pour in the honey and stir to combine.Boil without stirring until the syrup reaches a soft ball consistency (239F on a candy thermometer). This process takes about 30  minutes.To test the consistency without the thermometer, take the pan off the heat and dip a teaspoon in the syrup. Let it cool down for few seconds and then drop it in a small cup with water.Once dropped into the water, it should form a mushy ball.Remove the syrup from the heat and let it cool down to lukewarm temperature. Now add the juice from a lemon and the orange flower water or the vanilla extract.Method to finish the baklava recipeRemove the pan from the oven and immediately pour the cooled syrup evenly over the hot baklava.Pouring the syrup over the hot pastries enables better absorption.With the chefs knife cut along the marked lines almost to the bottom of the pan. Let the pastries cool.Cut through the marked lines completely and carefully lift the pastries with a spatula and arrange them on a plate.Sprinkle the top with the reserved nuts and serve the Baklava for your parties and special occasions.

Cook for 5-6 minutes, stirring constantly, or until the strawberries become soft and mushy, and have released their juices.Add in the sugar and cornstarch stir vigorously to avoid forming lumps.  Continue to cook - and stir - for another 1-2 minutes. Remove pan from heat when the mixture thickens up and transfer the filling into a small bowl. Set aside.*To make the dough:In a pan, add the milk and heat on low flame for 1 minute until it becomes lukewarm. Turn off the flame. Now add a pinch of sugar and yeast to the lukewarm milk and stir it for few seconds. Keep aside undisturbed for 10 minutes or until froth appears on top of the milk. While adding the yeast to the milk, ensure that your milk is lukewarm and not hot, because if it is hot then chances are that your yeast will die.In a separate bowl, add sugar, egg, salt, melted butter, and the milk-yeast mixture. Whisk until all ingredients are well combined.Start adding the flour, 1/3rd at a time, and gently mix it with a spatula. Mix well, until a thick, sticky dough forms and all the flour is incorporated.Dump the dough on a well-floured surface and knead just until the dough is no longer sticky and forms a ball.This will take about 10-15 minutes.Alternatively you can even knead the dough in a food processor .Place the dough into a greased bowl. Put little bit oil on top of the dough, cover the bowl with a wet muslin cloth or a towel and allow the dough to rise at a warm place for at least an hour or until doubled in size.*To make the rolls:Once the dough has risen, put it on a lightly floured surface and gently squish the dough ball with your hands to make a rectangular shape. Now using a rolling pin, start rolling the dough while maintaining the rectangular shape. Roll it to a size of about 14 X 6"" rectangle.Now spread the cooled strawberry filling on the rolled out dough leaving about 1/2 inch border. On top of the strawberry filling, spread the grated chocolate.Start making the roll by rolling from the long side. (You have to roll length wise). Now using a serrated knife, cut out about 8 rolls and place them in a greased baking pan.Cover the pan with a wet muslin cloth or a towel and place it at a warm place to rise for about 45 minutes or until the rolls have doubled up in size.Once the rolls have risen, bake them in the preheated oven at 180°C for about 25 minutes or until they become golden brown.Once your rolls are baked, remove them from the baking pan while they are still warm. Otherwise they will stick to the bottom due to sticky strawberry and chocolate filling.*For the glaze:In a bowl, add icing sugar, milk, and vanilla essence.Mix well using a whisk or a spoon until you get a smooth and lump free glaze.Drizzle the glaze over warm rollsServe this Strawberry & Chocolate Rolls With Vanilla Glaze as a Tea Time Cake along with a cup of Golden Detox Tea or even Qahwa - Arabic Coffee if you fancy it.

Grind the soaked rice, coconut and salt in a blender adding water little at a time to make a smooth batter. It is important to add a little water at a time to grind the rice into a smooth batter. When you feel the batter between your fingers it should be smooth and not coarse.Once the Neer Dosa batter is ground, transfer it to a large bowl. Add enough water such that the dosa batter has a smooth flowing consistency. The consistency of the batter should be such that the batter has a very thin coating at the back of the spoon and not a thick coating. If if forms a thick later, then the you need to add a little more water. Grind the whole spices - Coriander Seeds, Cumin Seeds, Methi Seeds and Dried Red Chillies as well to a smooth paste by adding some water and add into the batter.Check the salt levels and adjust to suit your taste.The Neer Dosa batter is now ready to be made. The Neer Dosa is made very similar to the Rava Dosa.To make the Neer Dosa, we dont spread it on the pan like a pancake or a regular dosa. We pour the dosa batter on the hot pan and it will spread itself creating holes.Note: It is a good idea to use an iron pan, as the texture and the softness of the dosa comes out perfectly with an iron pan.To begin, make sure you have a greased and seasoned iron pan. Grease and preheat the iron pan until it is sizzling hot. When you sprinkle water on the pan; the water will sizzle and evaporate.Once you have the right heat on the pan; pour a ladle of the batter in a circular motion starting from the outer edges. The batter will sizzle and flow to spread itself. Fill in the batter where there are gap, but do allow the dosa to have a few tiny holes. There is no need to sprinkle oil to cook the Neer Dosa.The Neer Dosa cooks very quickly; when you notice the top of the dosa is no longer raw, the Neer Dosa is cooked and has a rich white colour. The cooking process will take less than 30 seconds per dosa.Slide a flat spatula from the sides of the pan and fold the Neer Dosa into a half and then into another half to form a triangle. Place the Neer dosa on a platter and continue to make Neer Dosas the similar way.Make sure you place the Neer Dosas away from each other when they are hot; as they tend to stick to each other. Once they cool down, you can place them one on top of the other; into a covered bowl and serve warm.Serve the Spicy Neer Dosa Recipe along with kori gassi Recipe,Bean Sprout & Corn Salad Recipe by the side.",https://www.archanaskitchen.com/spicy-neer-dosa-recipe,https://www.archanaskitchen.com//images/archanaskitchen/0-Archanas-Kitchen-Recipes/2018/Jan_-16/Spicy_Neer_Dosa_Recipe.jpg

Next cut in between the 4 portions and make 8 divisions(in a plus shape but leaving the center intact). Finally cut in between the 8 portions making 16 wedges throughout.Like a braid, take two adjacent wedges and place each wedge on the opposite side and twist further till centre and form the petal in the centre. Similarly braid every 2 adjacent wedges by twisting and making a flower formation at the end of the work. Seal the edges when you are at the end of every braid twist.Cover the flower with damp cloth and let it prove for another 30 minutes. Brush milk over the dough very gently without putting pressure.Bake in a pre-heated oven at 180 degrees for 18 to 20 minutes or until the top is golden brown and the bottom edges are brown.

Cover it, place it over a medium heat and allow it to cook until the juice is absorbed.If you are making a non-alcoholic version, soak the dry fruits in the juice of 3 oranges overnight or for a couple of hours at least. When baking the cake, cook them in the same juice until all the juices are absorbed.If for some reason you have not pre-soaked the fruit, you can also soak and cook them instantly in 50-50 mix of rum and orange juice to get the intensity of flavour in a shorter time. For best results, pre-soaking the fruit is recommended.Next, spread the cooked dry fruits on a plate and let it cool completely.At this stage, preheat the oven to 180 C.In a large mixing bowl, sieve together the all purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda and all the spice powders.Add the soaked, cooked mixed fruits in the flour and mix well so that the fruit is completely coated.

It will ensure that the cake remains studded with fruit, right through.Cream together the butter, ghee, egg yolks and the castor sugar until it is light and fluffy.Add flour-fruits to the butter mixture, alternating with milk. Ensure that you begin and end with additions of the fruit mixture. Stir well with spatula to blend uniformly.Next, beat the egg whites till they are stiff peaks. Add 4 tablespoons sugar and lime juice and beat again. Now, fold in the egg whites to the cake mixture. Add the caramel and orange candied peel and mix it using a spatula.Pour plum cake batter into prepared pan. Smoothen it well (If you like an uneven top, save a small handful of floured dry fruits and sprinkle it on top or arrange some blanched and peeled almonds in a pattern or you can sprinkle some dried cherries on top )Place the plum cake in the preheated oven and bake for about 90 - 105 minutes or till a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.Check for doneness after 60 minutes, as the cooking time will vary from one oven to another.When cooked through, remove the tin from the oven and let it sit in the cake tin to cool slightly.When the cake is still warm pour 1/8th cup rum or brandy over the cake and remove from the tin and cool it over a cooling rack.Serve it at Christmas or slice and store away for a tea time treat. Once the cake has cooled completely, sprinkle some more alcohol over it and cover it tightly with clingfilm.

1428,Cucumber Neer Dosa -Rice Pancake,"1 cup Dosa rice - soaked for 2 hours,1 Cucumber - cut into chunks,1/2 cup Fresh coconut - grated,1 tablespoon Salt,Sunflower Oil - for cooking",150,45,195,4,Mangalorean,South Indian Breakfast,41,1,0,0,0,0,0,Vegetarian,None,295,"To begin making the Cucumber Neer Dosa Recipe, wash the rice and soak it in water for 2 hours. Grind the coconut and cucumber in a mixer to a smooth paste.Next grind the rice separately by adding 1/2 cup water into a very smooth paste.Mix rice and cucumber batters together in one bowl and season with salt.If the batter is too thick add enough water such that the dosa batter has a smooth flowing consistency. The consistency of the batter should be such that the batter has a very thin coating at the back of the spoon and not a thick coating. If it forms a thick later, then the you need to add a little more water. Check the salt levels again and adjust to suit your taste. Cucumber Neer Dosa batter is now readyNeer Dosa is made very similar to the Rava Dosa.To make the Neer Dosa, we dont spread it on the pan like a regular dosa. We pour the dosa batter on the hot pan and it will spread itself creating holes.Note: It is a good idea to use an iron pan, as the texture and the softness of the dosa comes out perfectly with an iron pan.To begin, make sure you have a greased and seasoned iron pan. Grease and preheat the iron pan until it is sizzling hot. When you sprinkle water on the pan; the water will sizzle and evaporate.Once you have the right heat on the pan; pour a ladle of the batter in a circular motion starting from the outer edges. The batter will sizzle and flow to spread itself. Fill in the batter where there are gap, but do allow the dosa to have a few tiny holes. There is no need to sprinkle oil to cook the Neer Dosa.Neer Dosa cooks very quickly; when you notice the top of the dosa is no longer raw, the Neer Dosa is cooked and has a rich white colour. The cooking process will take less than 30 seconds per dosa.Slide a flat spatula from the sides of the pan and fold the Neer Dosa into a half and then into another half to form a triangle. Place the Neer dosa on a platter and continue to make Neer Dosas the similar way.Make sure you place the Neer Dosas away from each other when they are hot; as they tend to stick to each other. Once they cool down, you can place them one on top of the other; into a covered bowl and serve warm.Serve the Cucumber Neer Dosa Recipe with Kori Gassi and end it with a dessert  Konkani Style Mande/Mandige/Chavde Recipe.

1445,Kesar Pista Kulfi ,"3 liters Milk - (I use 2% fat),1/2 cup Sugar,1 teaspoon Saffron strands,2 teaspoons Cardamom Powder (Elaichi) - freshly pounded,1/2 cup Pistachios - finely chopped",60,35,95,4,North Indian ,Dessert,12,1,0,0,0,0,0,Vegetarian,lactose,296,"To begin making the Kesar Pista Kulfi, we will first have to condense the milk. For this heat milk in a heavy bottomed saucepan and bring the milk to a boil.Once the milk comes to a boil, turn the heat to low and simmer the milk with almost continuous stirring and reduce the milk to more than half its quantity. It is important to note that during the initial stages of milk condensation frequent stirring is important, but as it begins to start condensing and reaches less than half the quantity it is absolutely important that you stir continuously.This is because condensed milk tends to get stuck to the bottom and sides of the pan and burn; leading to a very unpleasant taste. Burning of milk is also toxic so you want to be extra careful.Once it is reduced to about more than half of its quantity stir in the sugar until it dissolves completely. Finally stir in the cardamom powder, saffron and chopped pistachios into the Kulfi milk mixture.Turn off the heat and allow the kesar pista kulfi mixture to cool completely. Pour the kesar pista kulfi mixture in the moulds until 3/4th full, seal them airtight and freeze them in the refrigerator. The Kesar Pista Kulfi takes a good fifteen hours or more to freeze.  If you get wooden ice cream sticks in the market, you can insert them in and freeze the Kulfis.Once frozen you can run the kesar pista kulfi moulds under water to enable easy release onto the plate and serve.Serve the Kesar Pista Kulfi for your Holi or Diwali Party or when you have an elaborate Indian Dinner Menu planned for your parties. You can also serve it to your guests during festival with some delicious appetisers like Paneer Tikka and Chaat items.

Grind the soaked rice, coconut and salt in a blender adding water little at a time to make a smooth batter. It is important to add a little water at a time to grind the rice into a smooth batter. When you feel the batter between your fingers it should be smooth and not coarse.Once the Neer Dosa batter is ground, transfer it to a large bowl. Add enough water such that the dosa batter has a smooth flowing consistency. The consistency of the batter should be such that the batter has a very thin coating at the back of the spoon and not a thick coating. If if forms a thick later, then the you need to add a little more water. Check the salt levels and adjust to suit your taste.The Neer Dosa batter is now ready to be made. The Neer Dosa is made very similar to the Rava Dosa.To make the Neer Dosa, we dont spread it on the pan like a pancake or a regular dosa. We pour the dosa batter on the hot pan and it will spread itself creating holes.Note: It is a good idea to use an iron pan, as the texture and the softness of the dosa comes out perfectly with an iron pan.To begin, make sure you have a greased and seasoned iron pan. Grease and preheat the iron pan until it is sizzling hot. When you sprinkle water on the pan; the water will sizzle and evaporate.Once you have the right heat on the pan; pour a ladle of the batter in a circular motion starting from the outer edges. The batter will sizzle and flow to spread itself. Fill in the batter where there are gap, but do allow the dosa to have a few tiny holes. There is no need to sprinkle oil to cook the Neer Dosa.The Neer Dosa cooks very quickly; when you notice the top of the dosa is no longer raw, the Neer Dosa is cooked and has a rich white colour. The cooking process will take less than 30 seconds per dosa.Slide a flat spatula from the sides of the pan and fold the Neer Dosa into a half and then into another half to form a triangle. Place the Neer dosa on a platter and continue to make Neer Dosas the similar way.Make sure you place the Neer Dosas away from each other when they are hot; as they tend to stick to each other. Once they cool down, you can place them one on top of the other; into a covered bowl and serve warm.Serve the Mangalorean Neer Dosa Recipe along with Manoli Curry or Egg Curry for Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner.
